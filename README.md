# demo for interview

Project can run with using docker-compose.yml on docker container.   

"configserver" will read config files from this repository. 

I preferred jdk 1.8 for development. 

For accessing and testing webservices easily "interview.postman_collection.json" postman collection can use which shared in this repo.

Project meets this requirement.

* spring based microservices and cloud architecture. (Gateway / Config-Server / Discovery-Server )
* Docker with compose deploy
* Swagger
* Lombok
* H2 - JPA
* Unit tests
* Clear sonarqube scan
* Saga impl with kafka usage
* service layer
